  utter_informations:
    - text: 'In 1548 the jurist Benvenuto Stracca, known to have been the founder of commercial law, sent a request to Pope Pius IV for permission to open the Universitas studii generalis cuiuscum scientiae et facultatis in Ancona; on July 25, 1562, the pontiff granted permission for the opening of the university, with the faculties of law and theology and the possibility of opening scientific faculties as well; the first prior was Stracca himself. The Ancona university was connected to the law school active in the city in the Middle Ages, from 1300 onward.\n Modern university studies in Ancona began, however, in 1959 with the establishment of the Faculty of Economics and Business as a branch of the University of Urbino. The Ancona university, founded by Alfredo Trifogli, did not receive recognition from the Ministry of Education until December 16, 1969, giving rise to the \"Free University of Ancona." At first it housed only the engineering faculty, whose classes began in February 1970. On October 23, 1970, the teaching of medicine and surgery began. On January 18, 1971, it was granted the status of a state university, which caused it to take on the name University of Ancona; during this same period the previously established faculty of economics was also merged. The university was enriched with the faculty of agriculture in 1988 and the faculty of mathematical, physical and natural sciences three years later. On January 18, 2003, it changes its name to Università Politecnica delle Marche.'
